# Ping Pong

#### This is my third individual project. I create a webpage that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 1 to the chosen number with exceptions.

#### By Mohamed Warsame

## Description

On this website I create an application that counts up to a number inputted and returns every number until then. There are exceptions, however. For numbers divisible by 3 they are replaced with "ping". For numbers divisible by 5 they are replaced with "pong". And for numbers divisible by 15 (i.e. divisible by 3 AND 5), they are replaced with "ping-pong".

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* I started with empty page
* Then I downloaded jQuery and Bootsrtap
* Create well defined specs
* Then I created my code using HTML, CSS, Bootsrtap, JavaScript and jQuery
* I also used a special font that I got from Google which I linked
* I committed throughout


## Known Bugs

One bug is user has to refresh each time in order to clear previous result

## Specs

| Behavior | input | output |
| -------- | :---: | :----: |
|The program takes in a number and outputs all numbers up to that number in a list | 5 | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5	|
| When a number is divisible by 3 , the program lists it as "ping" in output | 3 | 1, 2, ping	|
| When a number is divisible by 5 , the program lists it as "pong" in output | 5 | 1, 2, ping, 4, pong	|
| When a number is divisible by 15 , the program lists it as "pingpong" in output | 15 | 1, 2, ping, 4, pong,... 14, pingpong	|
